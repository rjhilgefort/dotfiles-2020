- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

### Tool Usage

- Whenever I ask you to notify me about things, or let me know about progress, always use this script like this `terminal-notifier -title "Claude Code" -message "message goes here"`. By default I would like you to ping me when you have prompted me for more input after I have asked you to do something.
